Problem - Write a code in java which takes string as input and compare the last element is same or not.
          If same print 'Yes' otherwise 'No'.
          
          
Code:

import java.io.*;
      import java.util.*;

   public class Main {

      public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
          String A="Hi This is AH";
          /* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. */
          char firstCharacter = A.charAt(0);
        char lastCharacter = A.charAt(A.length() - 1);

        if (firstCharacter == lastCharacter) {
          System.out.println("Yes");
    }  else {
        System.out.println("No");
    }
    }
}

Input1:
Hi This is AH

Output1:
Yes

Input2:
Hi This is AK

Output:
No


Explanation - In this challenge we are taking a string and comparing the first and the element of the string is equal or not.
              The idea is to use charAt() method of String class to find the first and last character in a string. 
              The charAt() method accepts a parameter as an index of the character to be returned.
              The first character in a string is present at index zero and the last character in a string is present at index 
              length of string-1
