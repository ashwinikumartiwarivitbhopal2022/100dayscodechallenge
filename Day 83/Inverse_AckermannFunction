Problem - Write a program in java to implement inverse Ackermann Function.


Code:

import java.io.*;
public class InverseAckermann {

	public static int inverseAckermann(int n)
	{

		// Check if the input is small enough
		// to solve directly
		if (n <= 4) {
			return n;
		}

		// Divide the problem into
		// two smaller problems
		int a = inverseAckermann(n - 1);
		int b = inverseAckermann(n - 2);

		// Combine the solutions of the
		// two smaller problems
		return a + b;
	}

	// Driver Code
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		// Define the input
		int n = 10;

		// Solve the problem using the
		// inverse Ackermann algorithm
		int result = inverseAckermann(n);

		// Print the result
		System.out.println("Result: " + result);
	}
}


Output:
Result: 76


Explanation - In this challenge we are using divide and conquer algorithm approach to solve the problem.
              It divides the problem into two smaller subproblems, solves them recursively, and then combines
              the solutions to obtain a solution to the original problem.The time complexity of this algorithm
              is O(Î±(n)), as the running time is bounded by the value of the inverse Ackermann function for the
              input size n. This means that the algorithm is very efficient and can solve large problems in a 
              relatively short amount of time.
