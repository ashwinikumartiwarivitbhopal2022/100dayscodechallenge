Problem - Write a program in java in which given two integers A and M, find the modular multiplicative inverse of A under modulo M.


Code:
public class GFG {

	public static int x;
	public static int y;

	static int gcdExtended(int a, int b)
	{
		if (a == 0) {
			x = 0;
			y = 1;
			return b;
		}
		int gcd = gcdExtended(b % a, a);
		int x1 = x;
		int y1 = y;

		int tmp = b / a;
		x = y1 - tmp * x1;
		y = x1;

		return gcd;
	}

	static void modInverse(int A, int M)
	{
		int g = gcdExtended(A, M);
		if (g != 1) {
			System.out.println("Inverse doesn't exist");
		}
		else {
			int res = (x % M + M) % M;
			System.out.println(
				"Modular multiplicative inverse is " + res);
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int A = 3, M = 11;
l
		modInverse(A, M);
	}
}


Input: A = 3, M = 11

Output: 4

Explanation: Since (4*3) mod 11 = 1, 4 is modulo inverse of 3(under 11).
One might think, 15 also as a valid output as “(15*3) mod 11” 
is also 1, but 15 is not in range {1, 2, … 10}, so not valid.


Input:  A = 10, M = 17

Output: 12

Explanation: Since (10*12) mod 17 = 1, 12 is modulo inverse of 10(under 17).
