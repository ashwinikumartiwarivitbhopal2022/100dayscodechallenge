Problem - Write a program in java which takes integer as input and implement exception handling with
          the help of try n catch block.
          
Code:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x;
        int y;
        
        try{
            x = input.nextInt();
            y = input.nextInt();
            float resp = x/y;
            if(resp%10==0){
                System.out.println(Math.round(resp));
            }else{
                System.out.println(y);
            }
        
        }catch(InputMismatchException e){
            System.out.println(e.getClass().toString().substring(6));
        }catch(ArithmeticException a){
            System.out.println(a);
        }
    }
}

Input 0:

10
3

Output 0:

3

Input 1:

10
Hello

Output 1:

java.util.InputMismatchException

Input 2:

23.323
0

Output:

java.util.InputMismatchException


Explanation - Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions
              anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing â€“ often changing the normal flow of
              program execution.As we know Java has built-in mechanism to handle exceptions. Using the try statement
              we can test a block of code for errors. The catch block contains the code that says what to do if
              exception occurs.
              
              So, in this challenge we are doing the same, we have taken  two integers  and  as input, you have to compute
              .If  and  are not  bit signed integers or if  is zero, exception will occur and we have to report it.
