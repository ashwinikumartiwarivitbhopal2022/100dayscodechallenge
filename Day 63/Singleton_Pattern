Problem - Write a code in java to take input as string and a static method and returns single instance of singleton class.


Code:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;
import java.lang.reflect.*;


class Singleton{
    public String str;
private static Singleton INSTANCE;

private Singleton() {}

public static Singleton getSingleInstance() {
    if (INSTANCE != null) {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
    synchronized(Singleton.class) {
        if (INSTANCE != null) {
            return INSTANCE;
        }
        INSTANCE = new Singleton();
        return INSTANCE;
    }
  } 
}

Input:
hello world

Output:
Hello I am a singleton! Let me say hello world to you.

Explanation - In this program we are making class 'Singleton' in which  a static method named getSingleInstance
              that returns the single instance of the Singleton class.We are taking input as string as we seen
              above and simply printing the output.
              
              The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
              This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
