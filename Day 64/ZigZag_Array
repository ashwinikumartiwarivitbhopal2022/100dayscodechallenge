Problem - Write a code in java to solve the problem of zigzag array for odd and even indexed array.


Code:

 import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.lang.Math;

public class Main {
  static int solve(int arr[],int n,int start)
  {
    int res = 0;
    for(int i=start;i<n;i+=2)
    {
      int to = arr[i];
      if(i>0)
      // make sure current element is less than its left neighboor
        to = Math.min(to,arr[i-1]-1);
      if(i+1 != n)
      // make sure current element is less than its right neighboor
        to = Math.min(to,arr[i+1]-1);
      // if curr value was decreased to "to", add the difference
      res += arr[i] - to;
    }
    return res;
  }
  public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int arr[] = new int[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
      arr[i] = sc.nextInt();

    System.out.println(Math.min(solve(arr,n,0),solve(arr,n,1)));
  }
}

Input:
N=3
A[]=[2,3,4]

Output:
2


Explanation - In this challenge we are solving problems of zigzag array whether it is even or odd indexed.
              We start traversing the array, for each element find the minimum value among the element ,
              previous element - 1 and next element - 1.The difference between current element and calculated
              minimum value is the moves required to correctly position these three elements.Similarly, keep
              doing it for the entire array and keep track of a sum variable.
