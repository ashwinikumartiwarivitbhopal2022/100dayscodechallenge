Problem - Write a program in java which takes class named Arithmetic with a method named add that takes 
          integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum and class named Adder that 
          inherits from a superclass named Arithmetic.Class should not be public.
          
          
Code:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

//Write your code here
class Arithmetic{
    int add(int a, int b){
        int sum=a+b;
        return sum;
    }
}
class Adder extends Arithmetic{
    
    
}

public class Solution{
    public static void main(String []args){
        // Create a new Adder object
        Adder a = new Adder();
        
        // Print the name of the superclass on a new line
        System.out.println("My superclass is: " + a.getClass().getSuperclass().getName());	
        
        // Print the result of 3 calls to Adder's `add(int,int)` method as 3 space-separated integers:
        System.out.print(a.add(10,32) + " " + a.add(10,3) + " " + a.add(10,10) + "\n");
     }
}

Output:

My superclass is: Arithmetic
42 13 20


Explanation - In this challenge firstly we are making a class  and a method that takes two integers
              as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum.In it class named Adder that 
              inherits from a superclass named Arithmetic.
              
              We are not responsible for reading any input from stdin; a locked code stub will test
              by calling the add method on an Adder object and passing it two integer parameters.
              
              We also not responsible for printing anything to stdout. Our add method must return 
              the sum of its parameters.
              The main method in the Solution class is printing  the following output.
