Problem - Write a java code to implement parameterized constructor with a set of definite arguments.


Code:

public class School
{
    String name;
    String contact;
 
    School(String n, String c)
    {
        name = n;
        contact = c;
    }
 
    void printData()
    {
        System.out.println(“Name:”+name+”\tContact:”+contact);
    }
 
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
       School s1 = new School(“Oxford High School”,”9638527410”);
 
       School s2 = new School(“Cambridge International School”,”9175346097”);
 
       School s3 = new School(“Nath Valley Central School”,”8529637410”);
 
       s1.printData();
 
       s2.printData();
 
       s3.printData();
    }
}

Output:
Oxford High School         9638527410
Cambridge International School                                9175346097
Nath Valley Central School           8529637410


Explanation - In this challenge we are implementing parameterized constructor with a set of definite arguments
              In this constructors are used to offering distinct values to varied objects of particular class.
              With a parameterized constructor for a class, one must provide initial values as arguments, otherwise,
              the compiler reports an error.Sometimes there is a need to call the default constructor from another 
              constructor of the same class.We can also pass arguments while creating other instances of a class. 
              In this way parameterized constructors fulfills the need to copy one object’s values to another.
