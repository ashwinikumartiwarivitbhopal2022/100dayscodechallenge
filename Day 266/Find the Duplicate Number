Problem - Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

          There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
          
          You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Code:
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
    HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (seen.contains(num)) {
            return num;
        }
        seen.add(num);
    }
    return -1;  // Just to satisfy the compiler, this should never be reached
}
}


Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
