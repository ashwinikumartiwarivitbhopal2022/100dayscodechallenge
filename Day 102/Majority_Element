Problem - Write a program in java which takes input as array and print the majority element from the given array.

Code:


import java.io.*;

class Main {
	static void findMajority(int arr[], int n)
	{
		int maxCount = 0;
		int index = -1; // sentinels
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int count = 0;
			for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				if (arr[i] == arr[j])
					count++;
			}
			if (count > maxCount) {
				maxCount = count;
				index = i;
			}
		}
		if (maxCount > n / 2)
			System.out.println(arr[index]);

		else
			System.out.println("No Majority Element");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		int arr[] = { 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1 };
		int n = arr.length;

		
		findMajority(arr, n);
	}
}


Input:
{ 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1 }


Output:
1


Explanation - In this challenge we are simply taking input as  array and printing the majority or highest repeating element from the given array.

              First of all we have to create a variable to store the max count, count = 0
              Traverse through the array from start to end.
              For every element in the array run another loop to find the count of similar elements in the given array.
              If the count is greater than the max count update the max count and store the index in another variable.
              If the maximum count is greater than half the size of the array, print the element. Else print there is no majority element.
