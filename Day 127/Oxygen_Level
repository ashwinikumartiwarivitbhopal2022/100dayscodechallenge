Problem - Selection of MPCS exams include a fitness test which is conducted on ground. There will be a batch of 3 trainees, appearing for
          running test in track for 3 rounds. You need to record their oxygen level after every round. After trainee are finished with all
          rounds, calculate for each trainee his average oxygen level over the 3 rounds and select one with highest oxygen level as the most
          fit trainee. If more than one trainee attains the same highest average level, they all need to be selected.
          
          
Code:
package myproject;

import java.util.Scanner;
class Oxygen {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
   	 int[][] trainee = new int[3][3];
   	 int[] average = new int[3];
   	 int max = 0;
   	 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
   	 for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   		 for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
   			 trainee[i][j] = sc.nextInt();
   			 if(trainee[i][j] < 1 || trainee[i][j] > 100) {
   				 trainee[i][j] = 0;
   			 }
   		 }
   	 }
   	 for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   		 for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
   			 average[i] = average[i] + trainee[j][i];
   		 }
   		 average[i] = average[i] / 3;
   	 }
   	 for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   		 if(average[i] > max) {
   			 max = average[i];
   		 }
   	 }
   	 for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   		 if(average[i] == max) {
   			 System.out.println("Trainee Number : " + (i + 1));
   		 }
   		 if(average[i] <70) {
   			 System.out.print("Trainee is Unfit");
   		 }
   	 }
    }

}

Input:
  95t
  92
  95
  92
  90
  92
  90
  92
  90


Output:
Trainee Number : 1
Trainee Number : 3
 
 
 Explanation - In this challenge the oxygen value entered should not be accepted if it is not in the range between 1 and 100.
               If the calculated maximum average oxygen value of trainees is below 70 then declare the trainees as unfit with
               meaningful message as “All trainees are unfit.
               Average Oxygen Values should be rounded.
               Input should be 9 integer values representing oxygen levels entered in order.
