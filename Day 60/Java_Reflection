Problem - Write a code in java which shows java reflection concept.

Code:

public class Solution {

        public static void main(String[] args){
            Class student = Student.class;
            Method[] methods = student.getDeclaredMethods();

            ArrayList<String> methodList = new ArrayList<>();
            for(Method method : methods){
                methodList.add(method.getName());
            }
            Collections.sort(methodList);
            for(String name: methodList){
                System.out.println(name);
            }
        }

    }
    
Explanation - Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program
              to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program. For
              example, it's possible for a Java class to obtain the names of all its members and display them.
              The ability to examine and manipulate a Java class from within itself may not sound like very much
              , but in other programming languages this feature simply doesn't exist.
