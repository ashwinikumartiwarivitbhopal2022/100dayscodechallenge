Problem - Write a program in java which shows inheritence concept.


Code:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

class Animal{
	void walk(){
		System.out.println("I am walking");
	}
}

class Bird extends Animal{
	void fly(){
		System.out.println("I am flying");
	}

void walk(){
        System.out.println("I am walking");
    }
     void sing(){
        System.out.println("I am singing");
    }
}


public class Solution{

   public static void main(String args[]){

	  Bird bird = new Bird();
	  bird.walk();
	  bird.fly();
      bird.sing();
	
   }
}

Input:

I am walking(from animal)
I am flying(from bird)
I am singing(from bird)

Output:

I am walking
I am flying
I am singing


Explanation:

In this challenge we are simply doing inheritence by using inheritance, one class can acquire the properties of others
Animal class has only one method, walk. Next, we want to create a Bird class that also has a fly method. We do this
using extends keyword.Finally, we can create a Bird object that can both fly and walk.

So,this means that a Bird object has all the properties that an Animal object has, as well as some additional unique properties.
