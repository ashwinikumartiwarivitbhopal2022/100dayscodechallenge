Problem -Write a program to create a class ,then extend the parent class implement overriding in it.


Code:

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class BiCycle{
	String define_me(){
		return "a vehicle with pedals.";
	}
}

class MotorCycle extends BiCycle{
	String define_me(){
		return "a cycle with an engine.";
	}
	
	MotorCycle(){
		System.out.println("Hello I am a motorcycle, I am "+ define_me());

		String temp=super.define_me(); //Fix this line

		System.out.println("My ancestor is a cycle who is "+ temp );
	}
	
}
class Solution{
	public static void main(String []args){
		MotorCycle M=new MotorCycle();
	}
}

Output:

Hello I am a motorcycle, I am a cycle with an engine.
My ancestor is a cycle who is a vehicle with pedals.


Explanation - In this challenge we are simply implementing method overriding with the help of inheritence.
              
              When a method in a subclass overrides a method in superclass, it is still possible to call 
              the overridden method using super keyword. If we write super.func() to call the function
              func(), it will call the method that was defined in the superclass i.e we are doing the same
              in the above challenge.
